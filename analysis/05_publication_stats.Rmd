# Comparing the fish-dominant and plant-dominant feed scenarios, under the BAU FCR scenario, we see that the plant-dominant diet has 81,352 more pixels impacted (there are ~6.5 million pixels on a 10km Mollweide grid) (Fig. 1). This difference is almost exclusively due to the difference in terrestrial crop impacts, with the plant-dominant diet having 80789 more terrestrial pixels impacted than that of the fish-dominant diet. 

# Overall, ocean pixels are impacted over a larger area: approximately 42% of ocean pixels, regardless of feed scenario. In comparison, around a quarter of land pixels are impacted. The global average proportion of habitat impacted ranges from 0.00001769810 to 0.00003439829, with the fish-dominant, regular FCR scenario having the largest global average impact (0.00000507).

# Pixels in which there are impacts under both scenarios, the plant-dominant diet has, on average, larger impacts on land, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, Canada, the Middle East, and Western Europe. In contrast, the fish-dominant diet has larger impacts in most ocean pixels, the United States, parts of South America, and China (Fig. 1b).

# Overall, our analysis reveals that terrestrial mammal species exhibit the highest impacts on average across all taxon, in the plant-dominant scenario. Of terrestrial mammal species assessed, 10% are above the 95th percentile proportion of total habitat impacted (Fig. 2). While birds, reptiles, and amphibians are exposed to both marine and terrestrial disturbance pressures, most of their impacts are derived from terrestrial based feed ingredients, with only a small proportion of their impacts coming from forage and trimmings fish raw materials, as these species are unlikely to be bycatch or have exposure to areas of harvest of marine ingredients (Fig. 3). Among marine taxonomic groupings, marine plants see the highest proportion of their global habitat area impacted (Fig. 3), and finfish have the widest range of proportion of habitat impacted, with around 5% of species falling above the 95 percentile of proportion of habitat impacted in the fish-dominant formulation (Fig. 2).

```


Look at efficiency of raw materials; how does proportional contribution of impact differ from proportional contribution of feed formulation?

1. Look at proportional contribution of total overall impacts per raw material
2. Look at proportional contribution of average impacts per raw material?

 -  When observing the proportional contributions of raw material impacts to total species habitats globally, we find that soybeans are inefficient when compared to their proportional contribution to feed formulation. That is, soybeans represent 17% and 22% of the feed formulation, but 36% and 47% of the species area of total habitat impacted under the fish-dominant and plant-dominant scenarios, respectively. Compared to all of the other raw materials, we observe either nearly equal, or efficient percentages (Fig. 3). When observing proportional contribution to average global impacts across species, we find that soybeans are again the most inefficient, but within the fish-dominant formulation, representing 27% of the average impacts but only 10% of the feed. The most efficient ingredient, a result of our allocation approach, is trimmings fish, representing only 0.1% of the average impacts, but 13%

## wow ok some interesting results! Soybean is highly inefficient! Rapeseed doesn't appear to be that bad...

#  - soybean accounts for 17% of the feed, however, it accounts for ~36% of the impacts. 
#  - forage fish ingredients account for 42% of the fish dominant feed and only ~41% of the impacts.

# For the plant-dominant diet:
#  - Soybeans are 22% of the feeds but account for ~47% of the impacts.

How much of impact does Norway account for?

How much salmon aquaculture production does NOR produce? 

```{r}

production <- readRDS(here("data/tidy_data/production-data/aquaculture_production_tidy.rds")) 


salmon_production <- production %>%
  filter(species == "Atlantic salmon" & year == 2020,
         value > 0) %>%
  mutate(species = "salmon")

1388433.84/sum(salmon_production$value) # 51%

```

Check to see how efficient FCR impacts compare to regular. 
 - Does a 10% decrease in FCR = 10% decrease in impacts? 
 
 YES - because we assume trade relationships stay the same regardless of scenario.

   
```{r}

fcr_comparison_df <- all_overlap %>% 
  filter(allocation == "economic") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = fcr_type, values_from = impact_total) %>%
  mutate(difference = regular - efficient) %>%
  mutate(percent_difference = ((difference)/regular)*100) %>%
  mutate(percent_difference = ifelse(is.nan(percent_difference), 0, percent_difference)) %>%
  filter(vulnerability != 0, 
         percent_difference != 0) # perfect... all 10 or very close to it

test <- fcr_comparison_df %>% 
  filter(percent_difference < 0)


test2 <- fcr_comparison_df %>%
  filter(percent_difference != 0) %>%
  group_by(diet) %>% 
  summarise(mean_diff = mean(percent_difference, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ungroup()

# A tibble: 2 Ã— 2
#   diet           mean_diff

How many species have both marine and terrestrial impacts? 

```{r}

test <- all_overlap %>%
  filter(spp_type %in% c("Bird", "Amphibians", "Reptiles")) %>%

  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredient_type, values_from = impact_total)

unique(test$sciname) # 46 amphibians, reptiles, or birds which have marine impacts

## do any of them have both??

            terrestrial = sum(terrestrial, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%

  filter(marine > 0, terrestrial > 0) ## nope, none of them have both

```

Why do we see higher impacts for macrophytes and benthic creates nave high prop impacted? 

1. Lower total AOH, so higher props. 
2. Destructive gear types like trawling and dregding
