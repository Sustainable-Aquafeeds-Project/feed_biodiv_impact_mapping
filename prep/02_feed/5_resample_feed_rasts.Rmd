Goal: Resample all crop and fish based feed rasters to 100km2 cells

```{r}

library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(countrycode)
library(tidytext)

library(strex)
library(sjmisc)

focus_year = 2021

source(here("src/fxns.R"))

```

We will present data at at ~10km resolution in the WGS84 Mollweide coordinate reference system, an equal area projection that retains considerable accuracy in area at polar latitudes.

Reproject and aggregate the ingredient crop rasters
